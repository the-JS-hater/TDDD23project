== Game Idea

A smash-bros style game, but instead of typical fighting game mechanics a focus
on insta kill items. The emphasis of the games challange should be based on
mastering movement an effectivley manuvering around the level/arena. There
would then be different playable charectrs that move in slightly different
manners with pros/cons. The game would be competetive local-multiplayer, and
should have a fast-paced feel to it.

== Game Tech 

Raylib, a games programming library written in C #link("https://www.raylib.com/")

The library has easy to use functions for servicing basic video game needs such
as rendering images/models, playing sounds, reading inputs, setting up a window
and some more. 

== Progression in the Game

Various characters with different movement sets to master, and various maps
will have various items that differ in how to utilize them effectivley. So
there is alot of room for player imprivement, and in various
domains/directions. 

Various levels can also make movement more challanging
through enviormental effects/obstacles, since movement is supposed to be a core
aspect if the games skill element. Obviosuly there should be some
simpler/easier levels and some way to ensure that these are the first ones
encountered by new players. 

== In-game feedback and visuals for teaching the game

For items the look/animation, and to some extent the sound design, should
inform the player on what effects the item has. The players are going to have
to figure out alot of details through experimentation. Since it's a comptetive
game it's supposed to be played repeatedly. The biggest aprt of the experience
of such games is after all the act of self improvement, and learning/mastery
